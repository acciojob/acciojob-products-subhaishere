# Acciojob Products

#### You're given an HTML file containing divs representing AccioJob's products. Using only CSS, align the products in three rows following these specifications:

- The first row contains DSA and MERN, in that order.
    - DSA has a width of 50% of the width of the container, MERN has a width of 30% of the width of the container, and all of the remaining horizontal space is between them.
    - MERN has a height of 75px, and DSA is vertically centered in the row.
    
- The second row contains just AccioJob, which has a width of 75% of the width of the container and is horizontally centered.

- The third row contains BunisessAnalytics and Spring, in that order.
    - BunisessAnalytics has a width of 40% of the width of the container, and Spring takes up any remaining horizontal space, leaving 10px between the two products.
    - Spring has a height of 75px, and BunisessAnalytics hugs the bottom of the row.
    
- The three rows have 24px of vertical spacing between them.
- All other styles are either browser-default styles or styles from the starting code.
